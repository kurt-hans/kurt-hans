- 👋 Hi, I’m @kurt-hans
- 👀 I’m interested in welding, fabrication, LEDs, Arduino, RasPi, networking and home controls
- 🌱 I’m currently learning barely enough programming to get small projects to work (its a hobby, not my real job)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I have trouble with. I'm a thinker and problem solver, not a good programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
